# Target user profile:

The final user will be the person in charge of hiring new employees.
This person looks through hundreds of CVs so in my project he is expected to find a visually appealing, clear and comprehensive resume of my academical and work skills. Hopefully not boring to read and appealing enough to catch his attention.

# Information architecture:

Blabla

# Visual design:

My color palette contains: blue, white and grey.

The layout of the page consists on two columns, the one in the left serves as a presentation of myself with a picture and general information and the one on the right is the main content of the CV with my Eductaion, Work Experience...
The Presentation column uses dark blue as the background color and white and light blue for the content.
The Main content column uses light gray as background color, dark blue for the content titles and dark and light gray for the content.

The typography I used for all the text is Inter (the default typography of Figma).

I looked at other CV templates on Figma and decided to mimic this one: https://www.figma.com/file/JPxXfeeXFqo2a7LQ0Acj0b/CV-Template-for-Figma-(Community)?type=design&node-id=28-1&mode=design&t=KiXL27ymG2UcvNMc-0
